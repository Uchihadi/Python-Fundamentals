Q1: Print three variables with "|" symbol as seperator
age1 = 10
age2 = 20
age3 = 30

print(age1, "|", age2, "|", age3)

Q2: Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd. Print "even" if the number is even and "odd" if the number is odd.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if num <= 0:
    print ("Sorry number is invalid")
elif num % 2 != 0:
    print ("odd")
else:
    print ("even")

Q3: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Initialise Factorial
factorial = 1

if num < 0:
    print ("Sorry the number is invalid")
elif num == 0:
    print ("Factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
    for i in range (1, num+1):
        factorial*=i
        i+=1
        # Factorial initialises at 1, i increments by 1 for every for loop hence each factorials will keep increase after every for loop

print (factorial)

Q4: Write a program that prints all the prime numbers between 1 and a given number.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

def prime_num(num):
    prime_list = []
    for i in range(1,num):
        for j in range(2, int(i/2)+1):
                if i % j == 0:
                    break
        else:
                prime_list.append(i)
    return prime_list

print(prime_num(num))
   
Q5: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then counts the number of vowels and consonants in the string.
def wordcount():
    word = input("Enter the string: ")
    vowel_count = 0
    consonant_count = 0
    
    for i in word:
        if i == 'a' or i == 'e' or i == 'i' or i == 'o' or i == "u":
            vowel_count+=1
        else:
            consonant_count += 1
    print("There are a number of", vowel_count, "vowels")
    print("There are a number of", consonant_count, "consonant")

wordcount()

Q6: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and then prints the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
def list_number():
    total = 0
    
    users_list = input("Please input a list of numbers: ")
    list = users_list.split()
    for i in list:
        i = int(i)
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += i
    print(total)

list_number()
